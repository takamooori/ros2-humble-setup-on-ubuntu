# environment setup
### move to where you install ros2 to check "setup.bash"
```
cd /opt/ros/humble/
```
 then you can see setup.bash

### Sourcing the setup script
 For each terminal, you need to run this code below ( you can see more easy way later)
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
to avoid running this command everytime, add this code in bashrc
```
gedit ~/.bashrc
``` 
and add "source source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" at the end of line

##### check you can see return instead of "command not found"
```
ros2
```
